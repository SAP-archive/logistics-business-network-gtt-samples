## Limitations
1.	To integrate with visibility providers, the following code list sent out from ERP system should be consistent with the code list in Track SO Fulfillment template model: </br>
transportation mode code, shipping type code, tracked process type code, carrier reference document type code</br>  
2.	To integrate with shipment and freight order/freight booking at the same time, please implement the Track Shipment Extractor and Track SO Fulfillment Extractor in different ERP system. This is because Track Shipment Extractor and Track SO Fulfillment Extractor share the same AOT Type name. </br>

## FAQs
* Why are some stops missing in the map? </br>
Check if you have updated the right geocoordinates for those locations in the Manage Locations app. </br>

* Why are some actual events missing in the map? </br>
Only events with valid geocoordinates are shown in the map. </br>

* How is the shipment’s execution status changed? </br>
By default, the shipment’s execution status is “Not Started”. </br>
If the shipment’s planned event is reported, the execution status will be changed to “In Transit”. </br>
If the shipment’s all planned PODs are reported, the execution status will be changed to “Completed”. </br>
Once the execution status is set as “Completed”, it cannot be changed any more. </br>
You can set your own execution status logic in Event-to-Action. </br>

## How to Obtain Support
The project is provided "as-is", with no expected support. </br>
If your issue is concerned with SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace, log your incident in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.
